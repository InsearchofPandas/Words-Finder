        At this year's Golden Globes awards, host Ricky
        Gervais joked about Martin Scorsese’s now famous
        interview with Empire magazine, in which the
        director took aim at the current glut of superhero
        films. However well made, Scorsese explained, Marvel
        movies are closer to being theme park rides, rather
        than being “the cinema of human beings trying to
        convey emotional, psychological experiences to
        another human being.”

        Disney's profitable Marvel Cinematic Universe films
        contain plenty of both sound and fury, but I do not
        believe that they signify nothing. Instead, I
        believe that Marvel movies can be seen as 21st
        century attempts at creating meaningful myths. These
        films struggle to make sense of modern-day
        existence, and they certainly make use of very
        clever metaphors in attempting to discuss the human
        condition. The lessons might be disguised as fun,
        and the experience of thrills and joy might remind
        the viewer of a trip to Disneyland. However, I would
        argue that it isn't cinema that is lacking in
        today's superhero movies. Rather, there is an
        absence of a deeper understanding of human tragedy,
        and this results in stories that feel both weak and
        impoverished.

        The hero’s journey is a retelling of the same
        monomyth discovered by Joseph Campbell and presented
        in his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces. The
        story involves the process of moving from lost to
        found, and it is told in three acts. Act 1: the hero
        feels that something is lacking in life as they know
        it. Act 2: the hero goes on a journey to obtain what
        is missing or fix what is wrong. Act 3: The hero
        makes a sacrifice and as a result becomes more whole
        and/or satisfied then they were at the start.
      </p>
      <p class="content" >
        There are many ways to depict the hero's journey,
        but only two fundamental choices for bringing it to
        conclusion. In the first alternative, the character
        completes the cycle and becomes a hero. The Greeks
        referred to this result as comedy, and it is the
        approach taken by every Marvel story, as well as the
        occasional Scorsese film such as Hugo and Silence.
        The lesson from these stories is that the hero's
        strength and perseverance is ultimately rewarded.
      </p>
      <p class="content" >
        Then there is the second alternative, where the
        character attempts the hero's journey but fails,
        resulting in misery. This is what happens in the
        majority of Scorsese films, for example Raging Bull,
        Goodfellas, and The Aviator. When the hero's journey
        ends in failure, the ramifications are tragic, and
        the Greeks referred to this result as tragedy. The
        typical Scorsese work can be viewed as a cautionary
        tale that examines the character flaws and mistaken
        decisions which ensnare the protagonist.
      </p>
      <p class="content" >
        There are a lot of similarities between comedy and
        tragedy. Both are examinations of character and
        choices. The protagonist may or may not overcome
        their flaws, and in either case there is always a
        lot on the line. A well told story then becomes a
        learning experience for the audience. The problem
        with the Marvel films as they are being made today
        is that successful completion of the hero's journey
        is always just taken for granted. As Scorsese
        correctly observes, “the tension” in these movies is
        missing. When the audience is trained to feel
        entitled to a successful outcome, I fear that there
        are negative consequences for the greater human
        collective consciousness.
      </p>
      <p class="content" >
        Our culture has a strong tendency to deny the
        existence of tragedy. Even Scorsese struggles with
        this. His study of organized crime easily
        deteriorates into a glorification of the gangster.
        He intends his Wolf of Wall Street to be a warning
        about the dangers of greed, but how effortlessly
        does this cautionary tale morph into a dizzy
        celebration of excess. As the line between tragedy
        and comedy becomes ever more blurred, auteur Quentin
        Tarantino appears on the scene, intent on erasing it
        completely. Consider his latest work, Once Upon a
        Time in Hollywood, where one of the most famous and
        devastating tragedies in Los Angeles history has
        been turned into a violent comedy in the most
        revisionist historical fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Scorsese is right to point out the dysfunction
        that is so abundant in the present-day cinema,
        applying a narrow definition of the word “cinema” is
        a misguided critique of the situation. There is no
        need for the condescension implied by making the
        term so exclusionary. Instead, I feel it is more
        important to question whether we live in a society
        that wishes to remain blind to tragedy, and ignorant
        of the lessons that tragedy can teach us all.
